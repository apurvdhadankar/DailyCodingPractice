		 * the height of every tower by K (only once) where K > 0. After modifications,
		 * the task is to minimize the difference between the heights of the longest and
		 * the shortest tower and output its difference.
		 * 
		 * Examples:
		 * 
		 * Input: arr[] = {1, 15, 10}, k = 6 Output: Maximum difference is 5.
		 * Explanation: Change 1 to 7, 15 to 9 and 10 to 4. Maximum difference is 5
		 * (between 4 and 9). We canâ€™t get a lower difference.
		 * 
		 * Input: arr[] = {1, 5, 15, 10}, k = 3 Output: Maximum difference is 8, arr[] =
		 * {4, 8, 12, 7}
