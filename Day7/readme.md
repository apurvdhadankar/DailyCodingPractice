Day 7 of Arrays
Certainly, here are examples for each problem:

1. **Minimum swaps required to bring elements less than or equal to K together:**
   - Input: Array = [2, 1, 5, 6, 3], K = 3
   - Explanation: To bring elements less than or equal to 3 together, we need to swap the element 5 with the element 3. Thus, the array becomes [2, 1, 3, 6, 5].
   - Expected Output: Minimum swaps required = 1

2. **Minimum number of operations required to make an array palindrome:**
   - Input: Array = [1, 4, 1]
   - Explanation: To make the array [1, 4, 1] a palindrome, we need to change the second element (4) to 1, resulting in [1, 1, 1].
   - Expected Output: Minimum operations required = 1

3. **Median of two sorted arrays of equal size:**
   - Input: Array1 = [1, 3, 5], Array2 = [2, 4, 6]
   - Explanation: After merging the two arrays, the combined sorted array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The median of this array is the average of the middle two elements, which are 3 and 4, median is (3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5.
   - Expected Output: Median = 3.5

4. **Median of two sorted arrays of different sizes:**
   - Input: Array1 = [1, 3, 8, 9, 15], Array2 = [7, 11, 18, 19, 21, 25]
   - Explanation: After merging the two arrays, the combined sorted array is [1, 3, 7, 8, 9, 11, 15, 18, 19, 21, 25]. The median of this array is the middle element, which is 11.
   - Expected Output: Median = 11
