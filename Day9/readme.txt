Day 9 of arrays
1. Find duplicates in an array. (Without using any other data structure only using arrays)
2. Implement stack using array 
Following functions must be supported by twoStacks.

push(int x) –> pushes x to stack 
pop() –> pops an element from stack and return the popped element 
peek() -> Return last element of the array


3. Find min and Max of 2D array 

4. Partition an array such that partition subset sum is equal else return false
The partition problem is to determine whether a given set can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is the same. 
Examples: 
Input: arr[] = {1, 5, 11, 5}
Output: true 
The array can be partitioned as {1, 5, 5} and {11}

Input: arr[] = {1, 5, 3}
Output: false 
The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum sets.
