		 * 
		 * Note: Stock must be bought before being sold.
		 * 
		 * Examples:
		 * 
		 * Input: prices[] = {7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4} Output: 5 Explanation: The lowest price
		 * of the stock is on the 2nd day, i.e. price = 1. Starting from the 2nd day,
		 * the highest price of the stock is witnessed on the 5th day, i.e. price = 6.
		 * Therefore, maximum possible profit = 6 â€“ 1 = 5.
		 * 
		 * Input: prices[] = {7, 6, 4, 3, 1} Output: 0 Explanation: Since the array is
		 * in decreasing order, no possible way exists to solve the problem.
