Day 5 of Arrays
// 1. Find the factorial of a large number
int n = 25;
System.out.println(factorial(n)); // Output: 15511210043330985984000000
// Explanation: Factorial of 25 is a large number, and the output represents its value.

// 2. Find Maximum Product Subarray
int[] nums = {2, 3, -2, 4};
System.out.println(maxProduct(nums)); // Output: 6
// Explanation: The maximum product subarray is {2, 3}, and its product is 6.

// 3. Find the longest consecutive subsequence
int[] nums = {100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2};
System.out.println(longestConsecutive(nums)); // Output: 4
// Explanation: The longest consecutive subsequence is {1, 2, 3, 4}, and its length is 4.

// 4. Find the minimum element in a rotated and sorted array
int[] nums = {4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2};
System.out.println(findMin(nums)); // Output: 0
// Explanation: The minimum element in the rotated and sorted array is 0.
